This is the development code for the LOLBO implementation on nanocrystal structures. 

The primary goal is to develop code that utilizes the code base of LOLBO, 
and builds a framework that (1) works with our VAE (convolutional) latent space; (2) Integrate with the FANTASTX-GA. 

Develop using the IrOx dataset. Then use carbon dataset or other datasets (ask Zisheng or Davis).

Future explorations (if time permits): use Transformer VAE;
